Stri function: 

Base Case:
    (<= s CUTOFF)

Reduction Step: 
    (/ s 2)

Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
reach the base case:
    As long as the cutoff is > 0 and s starts >= 0, 
    repeated division by 2 will eventually be less than the cutoff.

Scar function:
Base Case:
    (<= s CUTOFF)

Reduction Step:
    (/ s 3)

Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
reach the base case:
    As long as the cutoff is > 0 and s starts >= 0, repeated division by 3
    will eventually be less than the cutoff.

Hailstones function:
Base Case:
    (= n 1)

Reduction Step:
    if n is odd, make n even by multiplying it by 3 then adding 1 (+ (* n 3) 1)
    (/ n 2) when n is even

Argument that repeated application of reduction step will eventually 
reach the base case:
    As long as n > 1, repeated division by 2 when n is even, 
    and adding 1 to the product of n and 3 when n is odd to produce an even number,
    n will eventually be equal to 1.
